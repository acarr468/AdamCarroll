            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>Over the course of two summers I worked as a software engineering intern on both the <a href='http://www.textronsystems.com/what-we-do/electronic-systems/reconfigurable-trainer' target="_blank">F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Maintenance Simulator</a> and the TH-57 Cockpit Simulator R&D programs. The F-35 program's responsibilities included testing simulation scenarios for correctness, writing task lists/technical documents for instructors, and testing the continuously evolving simulation environment for bugs. My main task for the TH-57 program was researching virtual terrain data options and ways to scale that data for use in the simulator. I was also tasked with recreating the simulated cockpit's terrain display within the program to ensure that it was as accurate as possible. I learned a great deal about software engineering and the processes required, as well as how to interact and work with the customer.

          <img class="qaproject_img" src="images/qa2.png" title="MultiQuery" />
          <!--<p class='image-substitute'>Q/A Project</p>-->
          <p class='info'>I studied how the presence of multimedia in a question that was posted online affected the quality and correctness of answers. Question types included text-only, text with an image, image-only, and audio only. I also studied the security and privacy risks involved with the incorporation of this multimedia into a question and answer website. These risks included loss of privacy through image metadata and facial recognition, and security risks to the website though illegal, malicious, and explicit content. The study was conducted using my research website, MultiQuery (Q/A Project), described below.<br/><br/><a href='http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_theses/2084/' class='qaproject-link' target="_blank">Click here to download a copy of my thesis</a></p>

          <!--<p class='image-substitute'>Q/A Project</p>-->
          <p class='info'>My research in preparation for my Masters Thesis involved building a website for a question/answer social network. The site allows users to ask/answer questions from friends and other users from various categories, and by using several forms of multimedia (text, image, and audio).  The site was built using Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database, and all work was done by me and another student. The site was developmental, and future versions will incorporate more aspects of the research such as rating algorithms and the forwarding of questions to the best users.<br/><br/><a href='http://qamultimedia.herokuapp.com/' class='qaproject-link' target="_blank">Click here to visit the website for this project</a></p>

          <img class="kadod_img" src="images/kadod.jpg" title="Knock-Activated Door Opening Device" />
          <p class='info'>I and another graduate student designed a Knock-Activated Door Opening Device that uses an Arduino Uno to detect knocking patterns on the door, and will pull down the door handle when the correct pattern is detected. Research was done to determine a proper and secure threshold for the knocking pattern input, and we authored an 8 page paper detailing our design, the finished product, and our results. This paper was voted to be the best paper among the entire class of graduate students and their projects.</p>

          <img class="80sim86_img" src="images/80sim86.png" title="80Sim86" />
          <p class='info'>My undergraduate senior project was an Intel 8086 Assembly Language simulator named 80Sim86. The focus and goal was to write a simulator in C++ that could be used to help students quickly learn the Intel assembly language in a simpler environment than current commercial software. With this program, the student is able to select one of 32 supported instructions via a select box, input one or more parameters/operands necessary for the given instruction, execute the instruction, and observe how the memory, registers, and named memory locations are affected. This interface allows for learning by experimentation without requiring the student to know complicated syntax or write an entire program in order to run a simple command through a debugger.</p>

          <h4><span class="sub">2011</span>Project STRATOS - Weather Balloon Into Near-space</h4>
          <img class="balloon_img" src="images/balloon.jpg" title="Weather Balloon" />
          <p class='info'>I and a team of roughly 12 other students designed, manufactured, and launched a 'package' with video camera to the edge of space via a weather balloon. Our payload also included a cellular phone for GPS tracking and an external battery to extend the life of the video camera during the long flight. We succeeded in both filming the edge of space at roughly 100,000 feet above the surface of the earth, and also recovering the device roughly 100 miles away once it had returned to earth.</p>
          <p class='info second'>Our payload was protected by a specially formed styrofoam box, hand warmers to keep the electronics from freezing, and a plexiglass window to allow our video camera to capture footage. My portion of the project focused on the GPS tracking, using a cellular phone and an online tracking service to pinpoint the location of our device as it both ascended from and returned to earth. I also served as the photographer on the recovery mission and drove one of the two recovery vehicles that enabled us to get to our device's remote location.</p>

          <img class="heroz_img" src="images/HeroZ.jpg" title="Hero[0] Logo" />
          <p class='info'>I and two other students worked together to create a computer game for a class project using the C++ language and the Borland IDE. The gameplay was similar to a Zelda style 2D maze/dungeon crawler, but with personal touches and inside jokes from our programming class thrown in. Over the course of about six weeks, we designed the game from the ground up including the class structure, gameplay, graphics, and storyline. I focused mainly on the programming side of the project, implementing features such as collision detection, map navigation, and points/scoring. The game included a graphical main menu with high scores, saved games, several playable characters, and even a 'cheat'/invincible mode.</p>

          <p>I am currently a Server System Validation Engineer for Intel in the Columbia, SC area. I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Clemson University, and a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Bob Jones University. I enjoy both the challenges of the software/programming side and the hands-on work involved with assembling and maintaining hardware. I have a special interest in x86 assembly, C, and other low-level programming, as it combines both software and hardware. I also enjoy web design work, both back-end and front-end.</p>
          <p>I have a wide range of work experience, working for both large corporations and small companies in the technology and educational fields. I love learning, especially when it involves computers, and am willing to tackle any obstacle presented by a new job.</p>
