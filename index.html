          <p>While at BJU I was a part of several major academic projects, culminating in my senior design project, 80Sim86. Please see my projects page for detailed information on each of the projects.</p>

          <p class='info'>My senior project was an Intel 8086 Assembly Language simulator named 80Sim86. The focus and goal was to write a simulator in C++ that could be used to help students quickly learn the Intel assembly language in a simpler environment than current commercial software. With this program the student is able to select one of 32 supported instructions via a select box, input one or more parameters/operands necessary for the given instruction, execute the instruction, and observe how the memory, registers, and named memory locations are affected. This interface allows for learning by experimentation without requiring the student to know complicated syntax or write an entire program in order to run a simple command through a debugger.<br/><br/><a href='80Sim86.html' class='80sim86-link'>Click here to see the website for this project</a></p>

          <img class="balloon_img" src="images/balloon.jpg" title="Weather Balloon" />
          <p class='info'>I and a team of roughly a dozen other students designed, manufactured, and launched a 'package' with video camera to the edge of space via a weather balloon . Our payload also included a cellular phone for GPS tracking and an external battery to extend the life of the video camera during the long flight. We succeeded in both filming the edge of space at roughly 100,000 feet above the surface of the earth, and also recovering the device roughly 100 miles away once it had returned.</p>
          <p class='info second'>Our payload was protected by a specially formed styrofoam box, hand warmers to keep the electronics from freezing, and a plexiglass window to allow our video camera to capture footage. My portion of the project focused on the GPS tracking, using a cellular phone and online tracking service to pinpoint the location of our device as it both ascended from and returned to earth. I also served as the photographer on the recovery mission and drove one of the two recovery vehicles that enabled us to get to our device's remote location.</p>

          <img class="heroz_img" src="images/HeroZ.jpg" title="Hero[0] Logo" />
          <p class='info'>I and two other students worked together to create a computer game for a class project using the C++ language and the Borland IDE. The gameplay was similar to a Zelda style 2D maze/dungeon crawler, but with personal touches and inside jokes from our programming class thrown in. Over the course of about six weeks, we designed the game from the ground up including the class structure, gameplay, graphics, and storyline. I focused mainly on the programming side of the project, implementing features such as collision detection, map navigation, and points/scoring. The game included a graphical main menu with high scores, saved games, several playable characters, and even a 'cheat'/invincible mode.</p>

          <h4><span class="sub">INFO</span>Basic Info About Me</h4>
          <p>I am a 22 year old Computer Engineering graduate student attending Clemson University, and I will be graduating in 2015 with my masters degree. I currently hold a Bachelors of Science degree in Engineering from Bob Jones University, and I love doing anything with computers. I not only enjoy the challenges of the software/programming side, but also the hands-on work involved with assembling and maintaining hardware. I have a special interest in embedded systems and other lower-level assembly language programming, as it begins to combine both software and hardware.</p>
          <p>My past work experience is mostly in the software industry, working for both a small web development company and a large aeronautics company during my school breaks. I love learning, especially when it involves computers, and am willing to tackle any obstacle presented by a new job.</p>

          <h4><span class="sub">HOBBIES</span>My Interests And Hobbies</h4>       
          <p>My personal interests include recreational running, cooking, computer magazines, tech news, and bargain hunting. I currently reside in Clemson, SC, but my hometown where I spent most of my life growing up is Charleston, SC. I am a born-again Christian with the goal of doing my best on any task while being as ethical and honest as possible.</p>
